# Visualization of the state machine
Develop a graphical application that will show the work of a finite deterministic automaton. For these purposes, it is necessary to be able to specify a finite deterministic automaton, which is defined as the set of alphabet characters, the set of states and the function (table) of the transition.

The visualization of the work consists in the following, a word is set from the characters of the alphabet, transitions from state to state are shown for this word.

The end of the work says whether this word is allowed by the specified automaton.
